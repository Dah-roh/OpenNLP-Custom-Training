After I went to the market I found out that I don't have any <START:oily-product> SoulMate <END>
<START:oily-product> hair cream <END> and also,
the <START:oily-product> Apple <END> <START:oily-product> Hair <END> hair cream my sister was using was also finished.
<START:person> Garry <END> has always hated
the people he worked with, Hairies and Apple are my best hair cares and they have helped me.
With all that gone, Amaka told me that <START:oily-product> Cool and flow <END> worked for hair and if I want to
get an equally beautiful hair I should try it also. When I got to the market I could only see
<START:oily-product> Cool Hair<END> oily-product to buy which was also very expensive.
<START:oily-product> Hairies <END>  and <START:oily-product> Dark and lovely <END> is now my new favorites that
<START:person> Clinton charles <END> used to <START:oily-product> Shampoo <END>
and <START:person> Garry charles <END> showed me. But Clinton told <START:person> Barry <END>
about the stupid things he's done. <START:fruit> Apple <END> was bought for food and eat at the market place. We also bought <START:fruit> Apples <END> oil hair creams.
